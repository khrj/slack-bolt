/**
 * Verify the authenticity of an incoming HTTP request from Slack and buffer the HTTP body.
 *
 * When verification succeeds, the returned promise is resolved. When verification fails, the returned promise is
 * rejected with an error describing the reason. IMPORTANT: The error messages may contain sensitive information about
 * failures, do not return the error message text to users in a production environment. It's recommended to catch all
 * errors and return an opaque failure (HTTP status code 401, no body).
 *
 * Verification requires consuming `req` as a Readable stream. If the `req` was consumed before this function is called,
 * then this function expects it to be stored as a Buffer at `req.rawBody`. This is a convention used by infrastructure
 * platforms such as Google Cloud Platform. When the function returns, the buffered body is stored at the `req.rawBody`
 * property for further handling.
 *
 * The function is designed to be curry-able for use as a standard http RequestListener, and therefore keeps `req` and
 * `res` are the last arguments. However, the function is also async, which means when it is curried for use as a
 * RequestListener, the caller should also capture and use the return value.
